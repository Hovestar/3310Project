\section{Conclusions}

The Yahtzee result happens so rarely that just rolling for a specific number
will result in a higher yield. Therefore, going for a Yahtzee is usually bad as
the chances are slim and one will actually get more points just going for a full
house.  However, this is just an average and with some variance and chance the
two results could favor the Yahtzee roller over the full house roller but only
in a few cases in a multitude of many games.  The results show how one can gain
an advantage with the knowledge of what really gains the most points in a game.

Yahtzee is a game a chance, but also a game of skill and knowledge. The game
promotes a risky play for a yahtzee, but does not reward the player with enough
to compensate the risk to roll of the specific roll. This results in a lower
chance to gain points while going for something of less risk and more reward,
like just going for the number six or going for a full house which occur
much more often than a yahtzee roll and yield a higher expected value overall.

So, the points awarded for each possibility is biased toward a safer and more
conservative playstyle rather than a wild and more radical playstyle of
obtaining a Yahtzee.

In conclusion, the game a Yahtzee is not a game of complete chance and one can
gain an advantage over another player once one understands the overall point
gains of each roll and a higher chance to win over somebody who does not.
