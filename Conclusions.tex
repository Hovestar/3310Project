\section{Conclusions}

Our results show that the point system for a game of Yahtzee is not necessarily
based on the expected values for each of the possible scoring criterea.
For example, while the expected value of a Yahtzee is about 2.3, the expected
value for a full house (which the game rules give less points to than rolling
a Yahtzee) is 7.8, slightly more than triple the expected value for a Yahtzee.
This shows that while the game's scoring system encourages a certain style of
play (namely, trying for Yahtzees), a much migher return can be expected from
rolling for different combinations (such as a full house).
