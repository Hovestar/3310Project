\section{Appendix I}

\subsection{Assumptions}
Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times2}$

$A =
\begin{bmatrix}
  a & b\\
  c & d\\
\end{bmatrix}
$

$a+b=1$\\
$c+d=1$\\
$a$ is the probability of moving from state $O$ to state $O$ in one turn.\\
$b$ is the probability of moving from state $O$ to state $T$ in one turn.\\
$c$ is the probability of moving from state $T$ to state $O$ in one turn.\\
$b$ is the probability of moving from state $T$ to state $T$ in one turn.

Let $XY_n$ be the event of moving from state $X$ to $Y$ in $n$ turns. \\
Let $P(X_n)$ be the probability of being in state $X$ on turn $n$.\\
Let $X$,$Y$ and $Z$ be generically either states $O$ or $T$.

\subsection{Derivation without Markov Models}

(1) $P(XY_2) = P(OY_1) \times P(O_1)+P(TY_1) \times P(T_1)$\\
(2) $P(Z_{n}) = P(XZ_1) \times P(X_{n-1})$
