Yahtzee is a game of chance, but is it properly weighted for each possibility?
In order to investigate this question, we will be looking at Yahtzee
through a mathematical lens. We will use Markov Probability Models to calculate
the probability of each point value found in Yahtzee's point system, and compare
our results to the values of points in Yahtzee. We will then be able to see how
fair the weighting of points in Yahtzee is.

Our models and results show that the point values for a Yahtzee are not weighted
according to the probability. Specifically, other options such as a full house
have a much higher expected value than a Yahtzee.
