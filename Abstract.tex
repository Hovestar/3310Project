Yahtzee is a game a chance, but is it properly weighted for each possibility?
In order to investigate this question, we will be looking at the game Yahtzee through the mathematical
lens.  We will be using Markov Models to see the probability of each point
value found in Yahtzeeâ€™s point system, and comparing the point system to the
calculated probability in our Markov Models to see the reliability on the point
system.which method to playing the game will result in the biggest gains and
the highest chance to win.

The point values do not reflect the probability of the rolls.  Even though
most of the point values follow a path of probable combinations, the game does
not reward equivalent, scaling values. So the real path to obtaining the greatest
yield is not to go for the yahtzee and in fact rolling for a yahtzee is one of
the worst ways to play the game.,
