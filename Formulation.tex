\section{Formulation}
	
	We will be using Markov Models to find the probability of the events. 
Markov models are graphs of events, that have weighted edges with the probability of their occurrence. 
This graph is then converted into a matrix where the values in row $n$ column $i$ represent the odds of moving from $n$ to $i$. 
This is a useful formulation because if you take the product of two of these matrices then it shows the odds of going from one state to another after 2 changes of state. 
A proof, mostly to convince myself, is in Appendix I for the two by two case.
